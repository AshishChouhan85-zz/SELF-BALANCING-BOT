# SELF-BALANCING-BOT

# INTRODUCTION
This is a basic code for running a self balancing robot and is still under development.
The working of the robot is satisfactory. The algorithm to run the robot uses concepts like
I2C Communication, Complementary filter and PID tuning.MPU6050 has been used to calculate the 
angle of inclination of the robot with the vertical.L293D Motor driver has been used to run two
DC Motors of 200rpm each.The robot only performs its basic function of balancing.
